* My parents were either going to name me Lynne Allison
*Or Allison Lynne
*After both of my grandmothers
*almost like a weird gift 
*and a way of saying thank you to both of them
*for bringing them into this world
*so that they couold have me.
*Their beautiful baby girl.
*But I don't like having the same name as my grandma
*it gets really confusing when everyone calls her Alli
*But Alli was alway my nickname
*and they call her Allison too
*But that's my name too.
*So I always respond when she is called for
*And she always responds when I am called for.
*It's hard around the house having the same name.
*So I go by Aloe instead.
